# ðŸ¦€ Rust Command-Line Tool

## Overview
This project involves a command-line tool where commands like `ping` can be executed interactively. It accepts parameters like `destination_ip` and is designed to be lightweight and efficient.

## Project Goals
- Create a command-line tool using Rust with minimal external dependencies.
- Focus on performance and reliability.
- Developed and tested with Rust 1.58.0.

## Getting Started

### Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
